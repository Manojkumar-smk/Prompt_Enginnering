<analysis>
Let me analyze the inputs:
Script Analysis:

Scene ID: "1_The_Panic"
Duration: 8 seconds
Characters: Hulk (IT Veteran, panicked/defeated) and Superman (confident)
Action: Hulk storms in looking panicked, Superman stands confidently
Dialogue: Hulk speaks in Tamil about his 20 years in IT and concerns about AI replacing him
Visual style: Media res start, extreme close-up on panic, shaky cam

Character Development:

Hulk: IT veteran (20 years experience), currently experiencing career anxiety about AI disruption, emotional, defeated, Tamil-speaking
Superman: Confident presence, likely a mentor/contrast figure to Hulk's panic

Length Consideration:

8 seconds is very short, so this needs to be highly focused
Approximate breakdown: 2-3 seconds entry, 5-6 seconds dialogue delivery
Fast-paced, intense energy needed

Style - "Panice" (Panic):
This style should influence:

Visual: Shaky cam, tight framing, high contrast, desaturated colors, rapid movements
Audio: Tense music, heavy breathing, urgent sound design
Performance: Heightened emotions, rapid delivery, physical agitation
Editing: Quick cuts, disorienting angles, tension-building

Adaptation Strategy:

Break the 8 seconds into micro-moments
Emphasize panic through all technical elements
Create contrast between Hulk's chaos and Superman's calm
Use bilingual context (Tamil dialogue with cultural authenticity)
Build production-ready specifications for each element

      "for_superman": "You are the eye of the hurricane. Your stillness makes Hulk's chaos more intense. You've seen this before, you understand it, and you have the answer - but not yet. Let us see quiet confidence, not smugness. You care about your friend."

    "camera_direction": "The camera is a participant in Hulk's panic. It should feel reactive, almost documentary - we stumbled into this moment. But don't make it so shaky it's unwatchable. Find the balance between cinema verité and controlled composition. Superman's shots should feel noticeably more stable - that's a storytelling choice.",
    
    "pacing_notes": "8 seconds is brutally short. Every frame must count. The entry should be shocking - bang, we're in it. The close-up should be uncomfortable. The dialogue should rush but remain intelligible. End on the question mark - literal and emotional. Leave them wanting the answer."
